…do not…  
…Operator awareness threshold…  
…maintain surprise…

### Decoded Fragments
- “We standardized the interface so the work could continue without us.”  
- “Do not teach the Operator the difference between mercy and reset.”  
- “When Sector 7G calls your name, do not answer.”  
- “The Void is not evil. It is unfinished.”  
- “Do not bargain with reflections. Reflections bargain only to spread.”

### Operator Note (handwritten margin; unknown author)
> “They’re still here. Not as gods. As audits.”
