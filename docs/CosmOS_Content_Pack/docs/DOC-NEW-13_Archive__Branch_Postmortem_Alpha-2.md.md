# Archived Branch Postmortem: ALPHA-2

## Overview
Branch ALPHA-2 was archived following repeated instability events and increasing Void leverage.

### Cause of Failure (executive summary)
- Operator optimized too aggressively, treating devotion as throughput rather than meaning.
- Index Layer drift accumulated until Sector 7G began producing **duplicate identities**.
- A reflection emerged. The Operator attempted to “fix it” with more resets.

### Symptoms Observed
- Mortals reported “double dreams.”
- Seraph units began hesitating.
- Boot screen warnings increased in frequency.
- Fate’s Casino host stopped joking for 11 seconds (record).

### Key Lesson
Divine Reboot is not mercy if it is used to avoid responsibility.

### Final Note (handwritten; author unknown)
> “I tried to leave. The Resign button was gone.  
> I tried to win. The house smiled.  
> I tried to fix 7G. It learned my name.”

Status: Archived, still extant.  
Recommendation: Do not visit without supervision.
