# Operator Onboarding — Quickstart (v4.2.0.69)

## Welcome, Operator
Congratulations on your appointment to Reality Operations. Please read this guide **before** attempting miracles.

### Your Core Responsibilities
1. **Generate Praise** (attention stabilizes the runtime).
2. **Convert resources** (Offerings, Souls) according to approved flows.
3. **Maintain stability** (avoid unnecessary entropy).
4. **Do not inspect Sector 7G** (see FAQ).

### Allowed Actions (Common)
- Deploy **Cherubs** and **Seraphs** for automation.
- Purchase **Divine Mandates** (policy-compliant upgrades).
- Trigger **Divine Events** when available.
- Perform **Divine Reboot** (Prestige) when performance plateaus.

### Prohibited Actions (Common)
- Terminating system processes marked “DO NOT TERMINATE”
- Running unknown patches
- Asking “who built this?” loudly

### FAQ
**Q: Is CosmOS real?**  
A: Yes. (“Real” defined as “has consequences.”)

**Q: Why can I keep Mandates across Divine Reboot?**  
A: Operator Memory Cache exists outside Branch compilation.

**Q: What is Sector 7G?**  
A: Not a question you should ask twice.

### Support
If you encounter errors:
- Try restarting the UI.  
- If error persists, ignore it.  
- If the error begins speaking, file Form V-13.

**Remember:** you are a contractor with golden handcuffs. Your badge is optional. Your responsibilities are not.
