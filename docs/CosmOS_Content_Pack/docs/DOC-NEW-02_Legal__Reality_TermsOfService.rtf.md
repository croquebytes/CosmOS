# CosmOS™ Reality Interface — Terms of Service (Excerpted)

**NOTICE:** This document is excerpted for Operator readability. The full Terms of Service are 11,432 pages and contain several geometries not renderable in your dimension.

## 1. Definitions
- **“Operator”** means the licensed user controlling CosmOS™ functions.
- **“Branch”** means a compiled instance of reality generated by operational changes.
- **“Divine Reboot”** means the creation of a new Branch with updated parameters and a fresh runtime context.
- **“Archived”** means Branches not currently active in the Operator’s primary viewport. Archived Branches **may remain extant**.

## 2. Divine Reboot Acknowledgement (Key Clause)
By initiating a Divine Reboot, Operator acknowledges that:
1) Prior realities may remain extant in archived form;  
2) Mortals retain no guaranteed continuity of self;  
3) Operator accepts responsibility for **emergent reflections**, including but not limited to: shadows, echoes, backups, and selves.

## 3. Liability
CMS is not liable for:
- Void bleed
- Mirror contagion
- Unauthorized self-encounters
- “Perfect existence” attempts
- Damage resulting from curiosity regarding Sector 7G

## 4. Termination / Resignation
Operator may request resignation by:
- Locating the Resign control in the UI (if present)
- Filing Form HR-NULL-0 (“Exit Request”)
- Receiving written approval from CMS HR (timeline: **unknown**)

**Note:** Resignation controls may be removed to ensure operational continuity.

## 5. Governing Law
Governing law is determined by **whichever universe remains**.
