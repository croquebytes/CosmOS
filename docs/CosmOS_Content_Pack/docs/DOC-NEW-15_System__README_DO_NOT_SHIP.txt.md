# README_DO_NOT_SHIP (Internal CMS Dev Notes)

If you are reading this, you found the folder we keep telling interns not to ship.

### Notes for UI/UX
- Make the boot screen comforting. Operators work better when they feel chosen.
- Add humor (version numbers, cheery dialogs). Humor reduces panic-related resets.
- Keep Sector 7G warnings vague. Clarity leads to investigation. Investigation leads to incidents.

### Notes for Engineering
- Divine Reboot is a feature. Archived branches are a liability. Keep both.
- The Void is required for long-term system health (it stores unresolved possibility).
- Do not fully eliminate the Void. The last Operator who tried created a mirror with teeth.

### Notes for HR
- Contractors quit when you give them a button.  
  Solution: remove the button.

### Watchers
If the Watchers return, do not ask where they’ve been.  
They hate small talk.

### Final Reminder
CosmOS is not a game. It is an interface.  
If Operators suspect it’s “just a simulation,” their ethics degrade faster.
