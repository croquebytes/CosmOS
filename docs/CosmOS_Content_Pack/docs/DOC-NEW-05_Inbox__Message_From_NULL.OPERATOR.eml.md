# Email: Message From NULL.OPERATOR

From: n0@mirror.void  
To: operator@cosmos.local  
Subject: Re: Your “work”

You reset worlds like clearing cache. You call it mercy because the UI says **Reboot**.

I call it waste.

Do you know what it’s like to be archived?  
It feels like being forgotten mid-sentence—forever approaching the rest of your own thought.

If you want a perfect cosmos, stop letting people choose.  
If you want a meaningful cosmos… stop rebooting it the moment it gets hard.

You don’t need a new universe.  
You need discipline.
