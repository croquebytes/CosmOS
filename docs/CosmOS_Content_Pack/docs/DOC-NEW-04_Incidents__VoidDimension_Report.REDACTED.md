# Incident Report: Void Dimension Entry (REDACTED)

**Incident ID:** V-Δ-040  
**Filed by:** Compliance Monitoring (watcher.whisperd)  
**Severity:** “Concerning” (tier below “Catastrophic”)

## Summary
Operator initiated sustained activity in the Void Dimension. Reality remained mostly stable. Several **unapproved sensations** were reported by mortals in adjacent branches (déjà vu, mirrored dreams, hearing the BIOS hum).

## Timeline (abridged)
- T+00: Operator enters Void.  
- T+03: Void reflects Primordial in ways not authorized by UX guidelines.  
- T+07: System logs show duplicate session token.  
- T+08: Redaction applied.  
- T+09: Operator continues working.

## Findings
- The Void appears to be **unresolved possibility** given texture.  
- The Void is a counterbalance to Primordial stability **and** a spreading corrosion.  
- Several Watcher signals detected as “whispers” rather than directives.

## Redactions
Portions of this report have been removed for:
- Operator morale
- System stability
- “Legal comfort”

[REDACTED BLOCK]  
“Do not let the Operator understand what the mirror is doing.”  
[END REDACTION]

## Corrective Actions
- Display additional warnings (Operator ignores these consistently)
- File HR ticket “Unauthorized self-encounter” (preemptive)
- Recommend: do not optimize too aggressively (entropy increases with efficiency)

**Closing Note:**  
CMS support does not cover mirrors that answer back.
