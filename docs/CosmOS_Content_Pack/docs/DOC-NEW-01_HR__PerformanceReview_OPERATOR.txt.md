# Quarterly Operator Evaluation (CONFIDENTIAL-ish)

**Employee:** OPERATOR (contractor; classification pending)  
**Department:** Reality Operations, Primordial/Void Coverage  
**Review Period:** Q∞-1 (as measured by uptime; not by your calendar)

## Summary
Overall performance is **Acceptable** with **Notable Deviations**. You demonstrate strong throughput in Praise acquisition and have shown initiative in unlocking the Void Dimension without submitting Form V-13 (“Mirror Entry Waiver”).

## Strengths
- **Resource Throughput:** Consistent Praise generation above baseline.
- **Automation Adoption:** Appropriate early deployment of Seraph and Cherub units.
- **Resilience:** Continued operation despite recurring warning dialogs, existential uncertainty, and minor corruption in Sector 7G.

## Areas for Improvement
- **Optimization Hygiene:** Excessive “quick fixes” increase long-term entropy.  
  *Recommendation:* Avoid stacking temporary buffs beyond the approved limit (see policy; access restricted).
- **Unauthorized Diagnostics:** You attempted to inspect Sector 7G. This is a known “curiosity hazard.”
- **Empathy Leakage:** You expressed concern for mortal continuity during Divine Reboot. This is not required for the role.

## Compliance Notes
- Your continued access to CosmOS™ is contingent on maintaining **Reality Stability Metrics** within acceptable thresholds.  
  *Appendix A: thresholds* — *restricted.*

## Action Items (Required)
1. Complete **Compliance Training: “Do Not Anthropomorphize System Warnings.”**
2. Acknowledge the following statement (click to sign):
   - “I understand archived branches may remain extant.”
3. Submit **one (1)** improvement plan that does not include “rebooting again.”

## Closing
Remember: **you are valued.** Replacement is expensive. Not impossible—just expensive.
