# Addendum: Divine Reboot is Branch Compilation

## Clarification: Divine Reboot
Divine Reboot does not rewind time. It compiles a **new Branch** using updated parameters.

### What persists
- Operator Memory Cache (Mandates, Achievements, certain Flags)
- CMS compliance state (your employment status)
- Some corruptions (especially Sector 7G anomalies)

### What resets
- Branch-local economy (Praise/Offerings/Souls counts)
- Mortals and histories (recompiled from rules)
- Most UI state (except settings; CMS loves settings)

### The “Three Layers” Model (internal)
CMS tracks reality as layered compilation:
1) **Runtime Layer** — what players see, moment-to-moment
2) **Rule Layer** — mandates, physics, constraints
3) **Index Layer (7G)** — identity pointers and causal addresses

When Operators reboot repeatedly:
- Rule Layer becomes patchwork
- Index Layer accumulates drift
- Void Layer gains leverage (unresolved possibility grows)

**Policy:**  
Treat Divine Reboot as a last resort, not a lifestyle.
