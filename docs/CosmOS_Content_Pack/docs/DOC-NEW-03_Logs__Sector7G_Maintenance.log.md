# Sector 7G Maintenance Log (Recovered)

[LOG START]  
Timestamp: ∞:∞:∞  
Author: Maintenance Department (Automated)

> Attempted reindex of **Sector 7G**. Index returned **names that do not exist**.  
> Some names were mine.

## Observations
- Sector 7G presents differently across dimensions (Primordial reports “File Not Found”; Void reports “File Found”).
- Crosslinks indicate **duplicated identity pointers**.
- “Dangling references” observed: entities referenced by history but absent from the world-state.
- Archive subsystem reports: **“Branch count exceeds recommended sanity.”**

## Actions Taken
- Applied patch: `FORGETFULNESS.dll` — status: **SUCCESS**
- Quarantined anomalies into folder: `ARCHIVE/UNINDEXED/`
- Set process status to: **NOT RESPONDING** (prevents Operator termination)

## Notes
Sector 7G is not a place. It is not a dimension. It is the **index of what belongs where**—the address book of causality.

When it corrupts, the universe forgets:
- where things start  
- where they end  
- who is allowed to exist once

## Recommendation
Stop looking for the source.  
The source is looking back.
