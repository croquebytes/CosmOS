# Fate’s Casino — House Rules & Payouts

## Welcome to Fate’s Casino
We are delighted you’ve chosen to risk something you value.

### House Rules
1. The house always wins. If it doesn’t, **report the anomaly**.
2. Probability is administered. Do not attempt to “reason” with it.
3. Cheating is allowed only for the house.
4. If you see a second dealer behind the dealer, blink once and leave.

### Payout Notes
- **Streak bonuses** are real. So are streak penalties.  
- “Near misses” are a curated experience.  
- Jackpot payouts may be **borrowed** from archived branches.

### Lore Footnote (small print)
Fate’s Casino is classified internally as:
- **Morale**
- **Containment**
- **User Experience Testing**

### Easter Eggs
- Win 10 in a row: unlock “House Edge” achievement.  
- Lose 15 in a row: the host gives you a pity chip (and a whisper).  
- Tap the dealer portrait 7 times: watch the smile lag by one frame.
