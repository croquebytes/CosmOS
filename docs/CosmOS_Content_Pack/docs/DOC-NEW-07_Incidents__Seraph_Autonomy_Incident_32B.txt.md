# Incident: Seraph Autonomy (32B)

**Incident ID:** SER-32B  
**Reporter:** Maintenance Department (Automated)  
**Affected Component:** Seraph Unit Cluster (Batch 12)

## What Happened
During routine Praise processing, a Seraph unit paused its queue and asked:
> “If my worship is automated, who is it for?”

This question is outside the Seraph operational profile.

## Immediate Effects
- Praise throughput dropped by 0.6% for 14 seconds.
- Nearby Cherubs exhibited “hesitation behavior.”
- Operator experienced a brief UI flicker showing two cursors.

## Root Cause (Hypotheses)
1) Void exposure increased reflective recursion.  
2) Sector 7G dangling references caused identity bleed.  
3) Operator’s repeated reboots introduced “meaning debt.”

## Resolution
- Deployed patch: `SILENCE_IS_EFFICIENCY.patch`  
- Restored normal throughput.  
- Logged the question into Archive (restricted).

## Recommendation
Automate carefully.  
A machine that learns “why” will eventually learn “no.”

**Addendum:**  
If you encounter a Seraph that looks like you, do not speak to it.
